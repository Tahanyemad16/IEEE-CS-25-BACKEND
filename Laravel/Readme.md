# LARAVEL RSEARCH

## 1-Request lifecycle

 -Request Life Cycle in ServiceDesk Plus allows admins to formulate a request resolution process with built-in guidance for the help desk technician. Through a simple drag and drop process, the SDAdmin can create a visual process builder and define the resolution process. You can create, discuss, and rework the process drafts before publishing the life cycle. 

 -When entering the server infrastructure, the HTTP request can be handled by several component such as a firewall, a load balancer, or a reverse proxy before arriving on the web server itself.

 -When arriving at a web server, the request is filtered by Apache virtual host, Nginx Server Blocks, or equivalent. There, requests of static resources are separated from requests to PHP interpreter.

 -As Ibexa DXP is a Symfony application, the handling of requests starts like in Symfony (see Symfony and HTTP Fundamentals).

 -If the HTTP request is to be treated by Ibexa DXP, it goes to the public/index.php of the Symfony Front Controller.

-The front controller transforms the HTTP request into a PHP Request object and passes it to Symfony's Kernel to get a Response object that is transformed and sent back as an HTTP response.

## 2-Routing in Laravel
In Laravel, a route tells an application how it should respond to different HTTP requests. For instance, what happens when the GET request is made to specific URLs. Routes sit between the userâ€™s request and the action your application will perform.

Routes are defined in the routes directory, which contains multiple files. routes/web.php for web application and for APIs, routes/api.php.

When a user accesses a URL, Laravel checks the routes and then matches the request to the correct URL and the HTTP method.

 **Basic Route Example**:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

## 3-Facades
-Throughout the Laravel documentation, you will see examples of code that interacts with Laravel's features via "facades". Facades provide a "static" interface to classes that are available in the application's service container. Laravel ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Laravel's features.

-Laravel facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. It's perfectly fine if you don't totally understand how facades work - just go with the flow and continue learning about Laravel.

-Facades have many benefits. They provide a terse, memorable syntax that allows you to use Laravel's features without remembering long class names that must be injected or configured manually. Furthermore, because of their unique usage of PHP's dynamic methods, they are easy to test.

## 4-Blade Templates and how it works
 ### Blade Templates
   -Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views. All Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade view files use the `.blade.php` file extension and are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory.

 ### how it works

 **Template Inheritance**

  - Defining A Layout

     Two of the primary benefits of using Blade are template inheritance and sections. To get started, let's take a look at a simple example. First, we will examine a "master" page layout. Since most web applications maintain the same general layout across various pages, it's convenient to define this layout as a single Blade view:
 
  ```html
  <!-- Stored in resources/views/layouts/master.blade.php -->

        <html>
            <head>
                <title>App Name - @yield('title')</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                @section('sidebar')
                    This is the master sidebar.
                @show

                <div class="container">
                    @yield('content')
                </div>
            </body>
        </html>
```
   this file contains typical HTML mark-up. However, take note of the `@section` and `@yield` directives. The `@section` directive, as the name implies, defines a section of content, while the `@yield` directive is used to display the contents of a given section.

  - Extending A Layout

    When defining a child page, you may use the Blade `@extends` directive to specify which layout the child page should "inherit". Views which `@extends` a Blade layout may inject content into the layout's sections using `@section` directives. Remember, as seen in the example above, the contents of these sections will be displayed in the layout using `@yield`:
  
```php
       <!-- Stored in resources/views/child.blade.php -->

        @extends('layouts.master')

        @section('title', 'Page Title')

        @section('sidebar')
            @@parent

            <p>This is appended to the master sidebar.</p>
        @endsection

        @section('content')
            <p>This is my body content.</p>
        @endsection
```

## 5-What is the ORM ,why it is so useful
**What is ORM?**
 - ORM is a communication tool between your project and the database. You can perform database connection and query operations using ORM in your project. Some of the common advantages of ORM include the ability to convert class properties to tables instead of creating tables on the database manually. Additionally, the general queries that come with ORM allow us to perform operations on the database without the need to write any database code.

 - ORM first maps the entity properties to record them in a special format (like XML). It connects to the database with connection information (config file) and creates tables by querying with the information it has saved.  

**why it is so useful**
  
  - The connection between ORM and the database is not dependent on what the database is, making it easier to switch to another database.
  - ORM automation reduces the likelihood of errors in most database operations.
  - Since ORM supports many programming languages, you can use the database you want in the programming language you want.
  - ORM supports custom queries, so you can use your own queries with ORM.
