## 1.How the web works.

 Understanding **how the web works** is not essential for writing web code in short term. But understanding what’s happening in the background will surely benefit you in long term.

 As already mentioned in my previous article titled What is web development, I have already mentioned that there are two parts to it, front-end and back-end technically called client-side and server-side. Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers depending on the functions they perform.

 Clients are the internet-connected devices of the web user (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi or your phone connected to your mobile network) and the web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox, Edge, or Chrome).

 Servers are computers that store web pages, websites, or applications. When a client device requests a webpage, a copy of the webpage is sent back as a response from the server and displayed in the user’s web browser.

## 2.HTTP VS HTTPS.
 HTTPS is just HTTP with verification and encryption. The use of TLS (SSL) by HTTPS to encrypt and digitally sign standard HTTP requests and answers is the only distinction between the two protocols. 

   **HTTP**

  - HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol using which hypertext is transferred over the Web. 

     Due to its simplicity, HTTP has been the most widely used protocol for data transfer over the Web but the data (i.e. hypertext) exchanged using HTTP isn’t as secure as we would like it to be.

   **HTTPS**

  - HTTPS is just HTTP with verification and encryption. The use of TLS (SSL) by HTTPS to encrypt and digitally sign standard HTTP   
     requests and answers is the only distinction between the two protocols.

## 3.Web servers.

  A **web server** is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.

## 4.DNS

  **The Domain Name System (DNS)** is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

  Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses.
